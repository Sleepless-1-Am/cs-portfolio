# CS 250 Portfolio Entry

## Artifact: Sprint Review and Retrospective
This repo includes my **Sprint Review and Retrospective** from CS 250. It shows how I used Agile and Scrum practices during the course and what I learned about teamwork and development.

## Reflection

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?**  
I use **user stories** to break down what the user wants into small, clear goals. This keeps the focus on what really matters to the user.  

**How do I approach developing programs?**  
I like working in **small iterations** so I can test, get feedback, and adjust quickly instead of waiting until the end.  

**What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**  
Iâ€™ll use things like **daily standups, sprint reviews, and backlog refinement** because they help teams stay aligned and catch issues early.  

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
It means **communicating well, helping teammates, and owning your work** so the whole team can succeed together.
